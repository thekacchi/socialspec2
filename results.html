   <div class="flex-box introduction">
    <h2>The Field</h2>
    <!-- Content for The Field -->
    <p>Your field represents your mind. Its
     size represents your knowledge of the
     world and how vast your personality
     is.
     The condition of the field is what
     your
     personality looks like at first
     glance.</p>

    <h2>The Cube</h2>
    <!-- Content for The Cube -->
    <p>Your cube represents you. The size
     of
     the cube is your ego. The surface of
     the cube represents what is visibly
     observable about your personality, or
     maybe it is what you want others to
     think about you. The texture of the
     cube represents your nature.</p>

    <h2>The Horse</h2>
    <!-- Content for The Cube -->

     partner. It could be playing, running
     around, or grazing right next to your

   <h2>The Flowers & Weather</h2>
   <!-- Content for The Flowers -->
   <p>The flowers represent your family and
    friends. The number of flowers reflects
    your popularity, and their location
    indicates how close you are with your
    social groups.</p>
   <p>The weather in your field reflects
    your general outlook on life.</p>

  <div class="flex-box introduction">
   <h2>The Storm</h2>
   <!-- Content for The Flowers -->
   <p>The strength and position of the storm
    reflect the stress you're feeling in
    life. As you probably guessed, the
    stronger the storm and the closer to the
    cube, the higher your stress level! If
    you imagined a storm raging right above
    your cube, it might be a good idea to
    work on reducing stress in your daily
    life.</p>
